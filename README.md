# U_NET_medical_segmentation
Accademic work on U-net implementation for medical images segmentation.

The colab/.ipynb file (open with google colab prefered) entitled "HW3_AUDREN" contains the "test_model" function. In the zip file "Test_predictions_through_epochs", you will find .png images of test predictions for various epochs and for three different models. In the colab/.ipynb file entitled "Unet_models", you will find the code to train every models, assess their performances and visualize the segmentation through epochs.
